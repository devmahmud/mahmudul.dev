Not exactly new knowledge, but today I felt like adding another utility alias to my toolkit:

```zsh
package-scripts() {
  cat package.json | jq ".scripts"
}
```

This tiny shell function spits out all the scripts defined in your ```package.json{:bash}``` file. It's a swift way to review available scripts without the hassle of scrolling through endless dependencies in the file.

For those dabbling with [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), the equivalent command would be a breeze: ```open package.json | get scripts{:zsh}```. Still getting my feet wet with nushell, so for now, this zsh alias will do the job.
