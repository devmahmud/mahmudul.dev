Managing multiple Neovim configurations is something I always find myself diving into. As someone who loves to experiment with different setups, I've been through a journey of trying to find the most convenient way to manage them all. I used to rely on [cheovim](https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/cheovim), but I found the experience not as seamless as I wanted it to be.

Enter the `NVIM_APPNAME` environment variableâ€”a simple, fast, and incredibly straightforward approach to handle multiple Neovim configurations.

With `NVIM_APPNAME`, you can control the directory Neovim looks for configuration files. Here's a practical example:

```bash
NVIM_APPNAME=nvim_personal nvim
```

This command will prompt Neovim to use a configuration located in `~/.config/nvim_personal`, making it act as the config folder for this particular instance.

This mechanism leverages the XDG directory structure, allowing Neovim to look for (and auto-create) configurations within various XDG parent directories. If you set the `NVIM_APPNAME` variable to "neovim", Neovim will look for files in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/neovim` instead of the usual `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`.

Here's the context from Neovim's help documentation to further illustrate this point:

```man
NVIM_APPNAME					*$NVIM_APPNAME*
The XDG directories used by Nvim can be further configured by setting the
`$NVIM_APPNAME` environment variable. This variable controls the directory
Neovim will look for (and auto-create) in the various XDG parent directories.
For example, setting `$NVIM_APPNAME` to "neovim" before running Neovim will
result in Neovim looking for configuration files in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/neovim`
instead of `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`.

Note: Similarly to the $XDG environment variables, when
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim` is mentioned, it should be understood as
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/$NVIM_APPNAME`.
```

In the end, the `NVIM_APPNAME` variable has allowed me to enjoy the process of experimenting with various configurations without the hassle. It's an elegant solution that aligns perfectly with my love for simplicity and efficiency.
