I have always felt that work in C++ projects was too cumbersome. I wanted to have a simple way to create a project, and I wanted to have a simple way to build and test it.

C/C++ third-party libraries are a pain to build, historically. You have to download the source, configure, build, and install it. This is a pain, especially if you are not using a package manager.

## [xmake] for the rescue

> xmake is a lightweight cross-platform build utility based on Lua. It uses xmake.lua to maintain project builds. Compared with makefile/CMakeLists.txt, the configuration syntax is more concise and intuitive. It is very friendly to novices and can quickly get started in a short time. Let users focus more on actual project development.

xmake is awesome and extremely easy for simple and even more complex and robust projects, it works as a package manager (which was the selling point for me) and as a project generator + build backend.

The **installation** can be done through `curl`, but there are other methods in their docs.

```bash title="terminal"
bash <(curl -fsSL https://xmake.io/shget.text)
```

## Sample project

To create a project we run:

```sh title="terminal" /(xmake|create)/
xmake create sample-project # Notice that sample-project is the name, you can choose any other
```

The xmake.lua file should look like this:

```lua title="xmake.lua"
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")

target("sample-project")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files("src/*.cpp")

-- A bunch of comments
```

First, I usually set the language to use the standard c++20 with `set_languages("c++20"){:lua}`, then I add a list of libs that this project will have, for now, I will only include the **[\{fmt\}]** lib with local `libs = { "fmt" }{:lua}`, removing the comments it should look like this now:

```lua title="xmake.lua" {1,4}
set_languages("c++20")
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")

local libs = { "fmt" }

target("sample-project")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files("src/*.cpp")
```

The folder structure that I adopted is having the includes and source folder for the application-specific scope like a library implementation and the standalone folder as the binary API entry point for the library.

```sh title="tree"
.
├── benchmark         (optional in case we need benchmark)
├── include
├── source
├── standalone
│   └── main.cpp
├── test              (optional in case we need tests)
└── xmake.lua
```

As we added the include and source folder for the library we need to adapt xmake.lua

```lua title="xmake.lua" /NOTE/ {6-7,11-12,14-18}
set_languages("c++20")
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")

local libs = { "fmt" }

add_includedirs("include")
add_requires(table.unpack(libs))

target("sample-project-lib")
  set_kind("static")
  add_files("source/**/*.cpp")
  add_packages(table.unpack(libs))

target("sample-project")
  set_kind("binary")
  add_files("standalone/main.cpp")
  add_packages(table.unpack(libs))
  add_deps("sample-project-lib")

-- NOTE: Requires a test library to be installed
-- target("test")
--   set_kind("binary")
--   add_files("test/*.cpp")
--   add_packages(table.unpack(libs))
--   add_deps("sample-project-lib")

-- NOTE: Requires a benchmark library to be installed
-- target("benchmark")
--   set_kind("binary")
--   add_files("benchmark/*.cpp")
--   add_packages(table.unpack(libs))
--   add_deps("sample-project-lib")
```

Now that we added the packages to the binary standalone when we run xmake to compile it the next time it'll be prompting us to download **[\{fmt\}]** through xrepo, the first time we download a version of a library it'll keep it at `~/.xmake/packages` for future projects.

Now, with <strong>standalone/main.cpp</strong> like

```cpp
#include <fmt/core.h>

auto main() -> int {
  fmt::print("Hello, {}!\n", "world");
  return 0;
}
```

We can run `xmake && xmake run{:sh}` to build and run the default target, if we want to specify another target we can run `xmake run target_name{:sh}` would produce the same effect as `xmake run sample-project{:sh}`.
