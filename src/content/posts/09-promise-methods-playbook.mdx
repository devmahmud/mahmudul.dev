# Promise Methods Playbook

> “Async without a plan is just waiting with extra steps.”

Modern applications often juggle multiple async tasks: fetching resources, uploading files, coordinating services. **Promise methods** help you orchestrate that work clearly and predictably. Here’s a practical tour with examples and when to use each one.

---

## `Promise.all()` — *Wait for everything or fail fast*

Resolves when *all* promises succeed, rejects immediately if any fail.

```js
const userReq = fetch('/api/user');
const postsReq = fetch('/api/posts');
const commentsReq = fetch('/api/comments');

Promise.all([userReq, postsReq, commentsReq])
  .then(async ([u, p, c]) => {
    const [user, posts, comments] = await Promise.all([
      u.json(),
      p.json(),
      c.json(),
    ]);
    console.log({ user, posts, comments });
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error("Something went wrong:", err);
  });
````

**Use it for:** scenarios where **all data is required** (e.g., rendering a dashboard).

---

## `Promise.allSettled()` — *Get a full report*

Waits for all promises, regardless of success or failure. Returns `{ status, value | reason }` for each.

```js
const uploads = [
  uploadFile(fileA),
  uploadFile(fileB),
  uploadFile(fileC),
];

const results = await Promise.allSettled(uploads);

results.forEach(result => {
  if (result.status === "fulfilled") {
    console.log("Uploaded:", result.value);
  } else {
    console.warn("Failed:", result.reason);
  }
});
```

**Use it for:** bulk operations where partial success is acceptable (emails, file uploads, notifications).

---

## `Promise.race()` — *First to settle wins*

Settles as soon as the first promise resolves or rejects. Handy for enforcing timeouts.

```js
function withTimeout(promise, ms) {
  const timeout = new Promise((_, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout exceeded")), ms)
  );

  return Promise.race([promise, timeout]);
}

try {
  const response = await withTimeout(fetch("/api/slow"), 2000);
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err.message);
}
```

**Use it for:** **deadline enforcement**, e.g., API requests that must complete within 2s.

---

## `Promise.any()` — *First success wins*

Resolves as soon as one promise fulfills. Ignores rejections, fails only if *all* fail.

```js
const mirrors = [
  fetch("https://cdn1.example.com/data"),
  fetch("https://cdn2.example.com/data"),
  fetch("https://cdn3.example.com/data"),
];

try {
  const fastest = await Promise.any(mirrors);
  const data = await fastest.json();
  console.log("Loaded from:", fastest.url);
} catch (err) {
  console.error("All sources failed:", err);
}
```

**Use it for:** high-availability strategies (multiple servers, CDNs, fallback APIs).

---

## `Promise.resolve()` / `Promise.reject()` — *Instant promises*

Creates a promise that is immediately resolved or rejected.

```js
const value = await Promise.resolve(42);
console.log(value); // 42

Promise.reject(new Error("Boom"))
  .catch(err => console.error("Caught:", err.message));
```

**Use it for:** wrapping synchronous values in async flows, testing async functions, or mocking APIs.

---

## `.finally()` — *Always clean up*

Runs whether the promise resolves or rejects.

```js
setLoading(true);

fetch("/api/data")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => useData(data))
  .catch(err => showError(err))
  .finally(() => setLoading(false));
```

**Use it for:** hiding loaders, closing DB connections, or releasing locks.

---

## Quick Cheatsheet

* **all** → wait for **everything**; fail fast on one error
* **allSettled** → get **all results**, success or failure
* **race** → first settled wins (use with timeouts)
* **any** → first successful wins (fault tolerant)
* **resolve/reject** → create promises instantly
* **finally** → cleanup runs regardless

Async gets easier when you pick the right method for the job. Keep this playbook handy, and let the runtime do the heavy lifting. 🚀
